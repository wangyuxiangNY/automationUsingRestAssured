Test cases: 

For Login:
1. Verify that user can login service fine with legitimate credential
2. Verify that user cannot log into the service using bad credentials

For Creating/querying/updating Users
3. Verify that creating user works fine
4. Verify that querying user by ID works fine
5. Verify that updating existing user works fine
6. Verfiy that search by Age range returns right result


Bugs found:
1. Update user(PUT request): Age is not updated
2. Duplicate users(Users with same email/age/first_name/last_name, but only with different ID) are created with no complain.
   But since spec doesn't spell out this rule explicitly, I didn't do dup check in the code. But you can see the dup in the log if you run the case more than one time.
